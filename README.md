Application development for men salon

Project Abstract --------------------
Men enjoy changing their appearance from time 
to time and keeping up with the current hair trends,
but due to job and family obligations, they have less
time to search for salons and wait in salons. They must
arrive very early only to get on the waiting list if they
want to get a time slot at a salon. This forces them to 
give up their enduring love for and dedication to their 
families, which is what, drew me to pick Application Development
for Men Salon as a project to be carried out. The project's major
objective is to allow customerâ€™s view Salon products and services
on the application and also schedule customer appointments 
at salons that are registered on the app and attract more men's
attention to fashion so they can see a difference in themselves
by becoming more attractive, which will increase their confidence 
and self-esteem. You can use the app to reserve time slots,
reduce wait times, identify salons nearby that are registered on 
the app, and check the costs of products that are offered in the 
local salon.

INTRODUCTION ---------------------------------------------------
-Background ---------------
The main issue is that men's salons around the world consistently 
see heavy foot traffic, particularly around holidays. Customer
service struggles greatly over the summer, especially during the 
holidays, to schedule appointments for consumers. The concept for
creating an application to address this issue originated from this
observation. As a result, I'm going to create an application that 
can be used by users of Android and IOS to make life easier for 
customers. I made the decision to call this program KIZCUTZ.

As the name implies the KIZCUTZ application provides the same
services that a typical salon would. It encompasses all forms of 
services that a particular Salon has and the capability to book 
an appointment with that salon.

We are aware that the majority of guys care about appearing 
presentable and routinely visit salons for haircuts, beard trims,
and other grooming services. They enjoy getting their hair
trimmed at the salon for special occasions, but they must make 
appointments by calling the salon during business hours or 
coming to the salon before the reservation date. This requires 
them to go to the salon twice and wait.

Men can occasionally be perplexed regarding the option of which 
salon is better as well. Additionally, they are unaware of the 
locations of each salon in their city, as well as the services 
offered, costs, level of care, and experiences of previous clients.


Aim of the Thesis----------------------------------------
The main goal of this project is to create and implement an
online platform for a salon to handle its transactions and 
enhance its business processes.

My concept provides a way for customers to interact with salons
through an application that they can download to their smart 
phones. This application preserves customer's time and effort 
by enabling them to find some salons nearby, make reservations 
from any location, try out sharing, and learn about all the 
services each salon offers along with rates.

Modern technology and new applications have altered our way of
life, and as a result, consumers utilizing the KIZCUTZ application
will have a more engaging salon experience with greater 
simplicity. It keeps to time, minimizes work, lists all salons
in one place, and boosts consumer confidence and retention. 
Customers can discuss their experiences, which motivates them to
return, organizes salon work, presents all services, promotes 
new salons and open positions, and motivates salons to lower 
pricing in order to draw in more clients.

1.3 The Document's Goal
Many basic concepts for a smart phone application, methods of 
system analysis, tools for system modeling, design considerations,
and system design are covered in this text. The KIZCUTZ 
application for smart phones will be implemented with the aid of
this analysis to make dealing with salons easier.

1.4 The Project's Key Elements
The KIZCUTZ application offers its users a wide range of services 
as follows:
The first service enables users to obtain a list of all 
registered nearby salons on the app and then select an 
acceptable salon from the list. Users can note down the address
and name of the salon and conduct a name-and-address search in 
the app database and if such Salon is registered on the app then
they will be able to see it services, products and prices.

The second service is that users can book a salon appointment 
online. Users can secure a time slot in the salon with the right
staff and spare time in their schedules after selecting the proper
salon. Next, they decide on a proper time and they select the 
best method for making payment.

The third service enables consumers to rate these salons so as 
to discuss their personal experiences with other users.

The fourth service allows users to create accounts in the app.

The fifth function allows you to access or view all treatments 
with prices in each salon and option to make payment.

This App will be easy to use because it allows the users to use 
it anytime and anywhere on a smart phone after downloading it
from the market
